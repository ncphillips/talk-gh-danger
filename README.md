# Talk: Github Actions + DangerJS

This is the source code for a talk I gave in November 2019 for PEI Devs.

## Step 1: Create a new Repository

```bash
npx tsdx create talk-gh-danger
cd talk-gh-danger
git init
git add .
git commit -am "init"
```

This new Typescript repo has 4 commands:

- `start`
- `build`
- `test`
- `lint`
